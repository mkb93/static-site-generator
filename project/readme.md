This is a simple project that converts markdown files to html files.

I've named it a static site generator

you can use it by making sure you have python installed.
then by running
./main.sh in the terminal will run the website on localhost://8888

at the moment the content and images are already set and once you run the code the markdown files in content will change too html files in the public folder
